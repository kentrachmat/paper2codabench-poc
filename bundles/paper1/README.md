# BELKA Small Molecule-Protein Binding Prediction

Auto-generated Codabench bundle from TaskSpec.

## Task Overview

**Type:** classification
**Primary Metric:** Mean Average Precision (MAP)

Predict whether a given small molecule is likely to bind to one of three protein targets (BRD4, EPHX2/sEH, or ALB/HSA) using a dataset of empirical binding measurements.

## Submission Format

**File:** submission.csv
**Columns:** id, pred

## Dataset

**Note:** This bundle does not include input or reference data. Only example submission format is provided in the `examples/` directory.

## Evaluation

Primary metric: Mean Average Precision (MAP)
Higher is better: True

## Resource Limits
